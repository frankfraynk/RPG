Need to add stats for player and make them make sense.

Player needs at the very least combat stats to refine the system.

Non-combat encounters will incorporate new stats

- Strength


    Will factor into damage and possibly hit-chance
    Will factor into non-combat strength encounters
- Speed
   
    
    Should maybe affect map movement speed
    Will factor into certain kinds of attacks
    Will factor into defending against enemy hits
    Maybe will factor into whether player or enemy goes first
    May differentiate into initiative
- Fortitude

    
    Will affect how much health the player has and how 'tanky' they are
    Saves against poison or reduced blunt weapon damage should come from this stat.
Need to make map work.

Need to add more functionality to weapons and armor

Need to work out how different attacks are going to work.

    Attacks will be their own objects, will have different damage values, hit chances, and effects
    Three different types of attacks, Weapon attacks, character attacks, and magic attacks
    Going to need to write a big ass attack handler that handles different kind of attacks
